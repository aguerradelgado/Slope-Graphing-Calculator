# Slope Intercept Graphing Calculator
# Desc:
Allows the user to convert either two-point form or point-slope form into slope-
intercept form. The prgram calculates the lineâ€™s length, angle, and degrees and graph the line for the user.
The program displays the graphed line and outputs all the calculated information. 
# Key Notes:
This project provides an introductory view to object oriented programming. Each aspect the graph created in the program has its own class header file and implementation file.
